This is a file meant to create a breath tracker and it is in collaboration with my friend Sofia. 
To run this program you must install Kivy along with python 3.11 or higher version 
You must run the installation and set your paths properly on your device 
Then you simply need to download this file and run the code and the program will appear as seen in the image file demonstration
